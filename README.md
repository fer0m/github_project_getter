1. Clone the repo
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/github-project-getter.git
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. Install required packages
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Run migrations
